gpseq-seq-gg \[Unreleased]
===

**This is the developmental branch of gpseq-seq-gg. For stable releases check the [releases page](https://github.com/ggirelli/gpseq-seq-gg/releases/).**

A pipeline for Genomic loci Positioning by Sequencing (GPSeq) sequencing data analysis.

More instructions are available in [docs](docs/). Also, please visit the [how to page](docs/how-to/) and the [F.A.Q. page](docs/faq/) for more details and what to do in case of an error.

#### Pipeline steps

1. Control quality.
2. Filter pattern.
3. Align reads and filter SAM.
4. Group and deduplicate UMIs (Unique Molecular Identifiers).
5. Bin and plot.
6. Advanced analysis.

More general information on each step are available in the [wiki](https://github.com/ggirelli/gpseq-seq-gg/wiki).

#### In development

* Enrichment test in provided data-track.
* Assign global radial position.
* Library complexity

### Pipeline setup
