* Implement reads reshuffling either on the merged bed and/or on the single bed files. Save the shuffled ones separately for future runs. Store the seed used for the random number generation. Remember that reads can be removed only from non-empty locations, but they can be placed back on any location (even the original one). Iterate at least 100 times per percentage of reads to remove.
* Calculate metrics on every reshuffled set. Then, compare the same metric on the different iterations against the original one using the Kendall tau distance.
